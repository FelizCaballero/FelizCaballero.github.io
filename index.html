        <img src="Paterson Great Falls.jpeg" alt="Falls" style="text-align:center;"><br><br>
        Here's a little about myself, I was born in Paterson New Jersey on a Saturday afternoon in May of 1992.
        An interesting thing about the city I grew up in is the history behind it and how it played a role in America's industrial revolution.
        Cotton and silk fabrics; steam locomotives; continuous rolls of paper; airplane engines. What do these things have in common? 
        They were all manufactured in the same place - Paterson, NJ.In 1792, Paterson was established, America's first planned industrial city, 
        centered around the Great Falls of the Passaic River. From humble mills rose industries that changed the face of the United States.
        The great Falls has a special place in my heart, I don't know why but just being close and listening to the water fall puts me at ease.

        My childhood was a very confusing time, this was mostly due a misunderstanding of myself and why I didn't fit in my environment well.
        I finished high school at age 19 and went straight to Rowan University, it was here that I really started to learn about myself
        through my limitations. I came across a something called the Myyers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), it's a system that categorizes a persons behaviors,
        actions and perception into 16 distinct categories. Through this I found out that my personality fits the category of the INTP aka "The Architect",
        people with this type are philosophical innovators, fascinated by logical analysis, systems, and design. They are preoccupied with theory, and search 
        for the universal law behind everything they see. They want to understand the unifying themes of life, in all their complexity. INTPs are detached, 
        analytical observers who can seem oblivious to the world around them because they are so deeply absorbed in thought. They spend much of their time in 
        their own heads: exploring concepts, making connections, and seeking understanding of how things work. To the Architect, life is an ongoing inquiry into 
        the mysteries of the universe.

        I will be explaining all I can about this system and how it helped me understand my weaknesses and limitations. It also helped explain
        my constant search for knowledge and academic improvement.
